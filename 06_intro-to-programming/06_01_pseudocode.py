# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
#
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any functional code, just map out the steps.


# Create a list of the kitten names and save to var
# For each kitten in the list ask the user if the cat is cute.
# if the answer is yes then print "cat name" is ready for adoption
# if the answer is no.. then print "all kittens are cute you are crazy... cat name is ready for adoption"
